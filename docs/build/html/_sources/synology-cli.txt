Интерфейс командной строки (CLI)

Обзор: Что такое CLI, как получить доступ к нему, SSH или Telnet?
---------------------------------------------------------

Что такое Интерфейс Коммандной Строки (CLI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The CLI is a Linux "shell" (a prompt based environment) provided by the Linux operating system running on the Synology Server to enable you to manage it at the Linux environment level. It is very similar to (but more powerful than) the old "DOS" environment for PC's

Как получить к нему доступ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To access the CLI you need to connect to the Synology Server using shell client software on your PC. Synology supports two methods (protocols) for the shell client to connect to the Synology Server, they are SSH and Telnet. The Synology Servers as supplied by Synology disable both SSH and Telnet. On firmware version 637 upwards you can enable the CLI using the Synology Servers own Web page based management GUI. For older versions of firmware (those prior to 637) Synology supply software patches for you to enable SSH and/or Telnet if you want to. Before you enable the CLI you should be aware this is defined by Synology as "Modifying" your product in software terms and therefore you may forfeit your right to software support as detailed in General Disclaimer on Modifying the Synology Server.
For instructions on how to enable CLI see Enabling the Command Line Interface

Какой протокол использовать - SSH или Telnet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SSH is generally a better option as it encrypts communication between your PC and the Synology Server making it very difficult for others to gain access to your passwords and see what you are doing. However windows PC's do not come with a SSH compatible shell application, so you would need to install one, a popular free SSH shell client is Putty as detailed on the Enabling the Command Line Interface page.
Telnet does not encrypt the data between your PC and the Synology Server, consequently your login password for the server is passed as "free text" and hence is visible to anyone "sniffing" the communication packets. However, if you only ever use it in a closed network you consider safe then this may not be an issue for you. Most PC's including Windows come with Telnet client software.
It is the Authors recommendation that you always use data encryption for passwords, consequently the author recommends you use SSH and install an SSH client like Putty if needed.

-----------------------------------
his document will guide the user in enabling the Command Line Interface (CLI) of the Synology System. The CLI is a Linux-based Shell, where users who are familiar with this interface can perform management and manipulation of the Synology System. 
Please note that improper manipulation or modification of the Synology server may result in machine malfunction or loss of data. 
Please read the General Disclaimer before modifying the Synology product.
This guide will cover two different protocols of accessing the same CLI, Telnet and SSH.

Enabling the Command Line Interface

This guide was written for Synology Disk Station Manager DSM2.0-0640 and above.
Step 1:
Begin by logging into the Synology Disk Station Manager using the Administration account.

Step 2:
Enable the CLI as follows
A) Open the Terminal Services Menu, from the Network Services Folder
B) Enable the Telnet or SSH Service, if you are unsure which to use please see the section "Which Should I Use, SSH or Telnet"
C) Click OK to confirm this operation

Step 3:
Check Firewall Setting (if firewall is being used)
A) Open the Firewall Menu, from the Network Services Folder
B) Double click enabled rule
C) In Ports Section, press Select button next to Select from a list of built-in applications
D) Make sure Ports 22 - SSH or 23 - Telnet are enabled
E) Click OK twice and then Save to confirm this operation
Service Specifications

Port Numbers:
Telnet: 23
SSH: 22
(Default) Login Accounts: root, admin
Password: Same as the administrative password of the Synology System
Note: Login will fail if password is blank/empty
If you want to login as another user (which for command line management makes good sense -- root is root and admin is the pgsql login which is needed at boot prior to optware initialisation to start pgsql up) then
Add the user using the DSM management page (the user needs a password in /etc/shadow)
ssh into the device as root
Edit /etc/passwd for the user so that their home path exists (e.g. /opt/home/username)
Edit /etc/passwd for the user to change their shell to /bin/ash .
NOTE: If you want to use bash (/opt/bin/bash - an extra ipkg package) instead of /bin/ash it fails for an unknown reason. Place the following in your users .profile directory to enable bash:
if [ -x /opt/bin/bash ]; then
 exec /opt/bin/bash
fi
Test new user ssh login
Note the default /etc/profile hardwires $HOME to /root, you probably want to change that
How to access the CLI

A terminal client must be used to access the CLI, such as Windows Telnet Service, or Putty for SSH clients.
For Telnet
Step 1:
Launch the Terminal Application
For Windows Users, go to [Start] -> [Run] and type without quotes "telnet synologyServerName" where "synologyServerName" is the name of the Synology product
Default names are: "diskstation" , "cubestation" , "rackstation"
synologyServerName can also be replaced with the IP address of the Synology product, for example "telnet 192.168.1.10"

Step 2:
Login using the credentials listed under "Service Specifications"
Telnet07.jpg
For putty (SSH)
Step 1:
Download and install Putty if you do not already have a SSH client.
Step 2:
Configure your SSH client with the correct paramters for connecting to your Synology Server. If you are using putty these are: Under "Host Name (or IP address)" enter your synology Servers IP address or server name, ensure "Port" is set to 22, ensure "Connection type" is set to SSH. If you want you can save this configuration by entering a description in the "Saved Sessions" dialogue box and click the Save button.
Step 3:
Start the SSH session, in putty click the "Open" button, or if you saved the configuration, double click on its name in the "Saved Sessions" list. A shell window will open and if it connects to the synology server a prompt will appear asking you to login. Login using the credentials listed under "Service Specifications". If putty could not connect to the Synology Server a blank window will open and after 1 minute a "Network Error: Connection timed out" message will appear. If this happens repeat the steps in this wiki carefully.
The Busybox

When you access the CLI (by Telnet or SSH) you are provided the same CLI provided by a small command interpreter called "Busybox" from BusyBox Origin with a few commands. An almost endless list of publicly accessible wikis discusses the features. I thus rather suggest a google search on BusyBox instead of copying content.

Основные комманды редактора vi 
--------------------------------------
The Linux VI Editor is a text based editor used Linux, useful for editing configuration files or creating plain text documents.
vi is started by simply entering "vi" (it is case sensitive) at the linux prompt, and once started is exited using ESC:q! to abandon changes or SHIFT+ZZ (case sensitve) to save changes. If you want to edit (or create) a specific file use the command "vi /path_to_file/name_of_file". "path_to_file" must already exist as vi will not make any required directories.
